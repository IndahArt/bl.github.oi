        <p>It’s a beautiful thing to fall in love with yourself over and over again. Remind yourself that you are worth it and that sometimes, </p>
        <p>it’s okay to think about yourself first before you think about someone else. I feel like I'm still not ready to receive all this love. It's very overwhelming."
          "I was a bit sick. The thought of my life being hard encouraged me a lot."
          "Thank to me for making me someone special. I won't take things for granted."</p>

          <p>There were many things in the past that didn't go as expected. And I would become bummed about those. But my inner child always cheer me on and it's a big strength that I'm started to loving myself.</p>
